Contrary to static noncooperative games that model an interaction among players in only one period, in repeated games, interactions of players repeat for multiple periods; and thus the players become aware of other players' past behaviors and their future benefits, and will adapt their behavior accordingly. In wireless networks, conflicts among wireless nodes can lead to selfish behaviors, resulting in poor network performances and detrimental individual payoffs. In this paper, we survey the applications of repeated games in different wireless networks. The main goal is to demonstrate the use of repeated games to encourage wireless nodes to cooperate, thereby improving network performances and avoiding network disruption due to selfish behaviors. Furthermore, various problems in wireless networks and variations of repeated game models together with the corresponding solutions are discussed in this survey. Finally, we outline some open issues and future research directions.},

	abstract = {Vehicular environments impose a set of new requirements on today's wireless communication systems. Vehicular safety communications applications cannot tolerate long connection establishment delays before being enabled to communicate with other vehicles encountered on the road. Similarly, non-safety applications also demand efficient connection setup with roadside stations providing services (e.g. digital map update) because of the limited time it takes for a car to drive through the coverage area. Additionally, the rapidly moving vehicles and complex roadway environment present challenges at the {PHY} level. The {IEEE} 802.11 standard body is currently working on a new amendment, {IEEE} 802.1 lp, to address these concerns. This document is named wireless access in vehicular environment, also known as {WAVE}. As of writing, the draft document for {IEEE} 802.11p is making progress and moving closer towards acceptance by the general {IEEE} 802.11 working group. It is projected to pass letter ballot in the first half of 2008. This paper provides an overview of the latest draft proposed for {IEEE} 802.11p. It is intended to provide an insight into the reasoning and approaches behind the document.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the vehicular ad hoc networking ({VANET}) concept has supported the development of emerging safety related applications for vehicles based on cooperative awareness between vehicles. This cooperative awareness can be achieved by exploiting wireless sensors and technologies to transmit periodic messages to neighboring vehicles. These messages normally contain information regarding vehicles, such as position, speed, distance between vehicles, etc. For the transfer of safety messages, Wi-Fi and the suit of {IEEE} 802.11p/{WAVE} protocols were commonly used initially but now cellular-based {LTE} and 5G are the emerging technologies for {VANETs}. In this paper, a comparison is performed considering the European {ITS}-G5 standard, Wi-Fi, {LTE} and 5G by exchanging safety messages in {VANETs}. We have exchanged real-time road weather and traffic observation data to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned wireless technologies in terms of successful message delivery probability. Our results reveal that due to weak communication links and the lack of line of sight ({LOS}) communication for Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios, Wi-Fi and 802.11p are outperformed by {LTE} and 5G networks.},

Although resource allocations on the common control channel ({CCH}) reserved for safety-related applications have been well investigated, efficient usage of the other {SCHs} is less developed. With new {ITS} safety-related applications appearing, such as autonomous driving or truck platooning, as well as the expected coexistence between {ITS} and non-{ITS} technologies for smart mobility applications, operating on multiple channels and efficiently sharing the {ITS} spectrum become critical. First, multi-channel operations aim at mitigating the communication load on specific channels by offloading part of traffic to alternate channels. Second, multi-channel operations aim at providing mechanisms to dynamically change channels and fit to the service requirements as function of external interferences or to varying traffic conditions. In this chapter, we describe the regulations and mechanisms for {ITS} multi-channel operation and coexistence in the {US} and in the {EU}.

While traditionally, the {IEEE} 802.11p standard provided the foundation for basic safety applications, the new cellular V2X (C-V2X) standard established by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has shown to provide improved range and reliability for enhanced safety services.

These requirements should be taken into consideration to enable the implementation of secure {VANET} infrastructure with efficient communication between parties. We give the details of the recent security architectures and the well-known security standards protocols. The second focuses on a novel classification of the different attacks known in the {VANET} literature and their related solutions. The third is a comparison between some of these solutions based on well-known security criteria in {VANET}. Then we draw attention to different open issues and technical challenges related to {VANET} security, which can help researchers for future use.},

The ambition of the European Commission and the {EU} Member States at this stage is to initiate and establish large-scale deployment of sustainable services on all road categories with the support of authorities at different levels, and to ensure interoperability, security, and seamless availability of high-quality services for end-users. This paper explores operational procedures for large-scale C-{ITS} deployment in Europe, and targets two groups of authorities, road operators and municipality members, as well as technical developers for the implementation of C-{ITS} services. The paper also, based on the most recent results, provides guidelines with technical details of the C-{ITS} services, such as Day-1 and Day-1.5 services, as defined by the {EU} C-{ITS} Platform for properly implementing pan-European interoperable C-{ITS} services.},

Due to the increase in powerful technology in modern times, {VANETs} play a vital role in uplifting daily concerns across vehicles and vehicular identities. Hence, to tune {VANETs} to become compatible with traditional technologies and increase demand, {VANETs} require upgrading.

Applications interact with controllers to implement network services, such as network transport with quality of service. SDN facilitates the virtualization of network functions so that multiple virtual networks can operate over a given installed physical network infrastructure. Due to the specific characteristics of optical (photonic) communication components and the high optical transmission capacities, SDN-based optical networking poses particular challenges, but holds also great potential. In this article, we comprehensively survey studies that examine the SDN paradigm in optical networks; in brief, we survey the area of software defined optical networks (SDONs). We mainly organize the SDON studies into studies focused on the infrastructure layer, the control layer, and the application layer. Moreover, we cover SDON studies focused on network virtualization, as well as SDON studies focused on the orchestration of multilayer and multidomain networking. Based on the survey, we identify open challenges for SDONs and outline future directions.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Network implementation has seen tremendous growth and deployment in different types of networks. Compared to traditional networks it decouples the control logic from network layer devices and centralizes it for efficient traffic forwarding and flow management across the domain. This multi-layered architecture has data forwarding devices at the bottom in the data plane, which is programmed by controllers in the control plane. The high-level management plane interacts with the control plane to program the whole network and enforce different policies. The interaction among these planes is done through interfaces that work as communication/programming protocols. In this survey, we present a comprehensive study of these interface and programming protocols, which are primarily classified into southbound, northbound, and east/westbound interfaces. This work first classifies each of them into subcategories and then presents a comprehensive comparative analysis. As the different interfaces have different properties, hence, the sub-classification and their analysis are done using different properties. In addition, we also discuss the impact of different virtualization techniques, such as hypervisors, on interface protocols and inter-plane communication. More over specialized interfaces for emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks are also presented. Finally, the paper highlights several short term and long term research challenges and open issues specific to the SDN interface protocols.},

	abstract = {The Internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where (almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere. However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms - with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability - as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

	abstract = {Emerging mega-trends (e.g., mobile, social, cloud, and big data) in information and communication technologies (ICT) are commanding new challenges to future Internet, for which ubiquitous accessibility, high bandwidth, and dynamic management are crucial. However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.},

In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},

As one of the initial implementations of SDN, OpenFlow abstracts a forwarding device as a flow table and realizes flow processing by applying the "match-and-act" principle. However, the protocol-dependent nature of OpenFlow still limits the programmability of the forwarding plane. Hence, in this article, we discuss how to leverage protocol-oblivious forwarding (POF) to further enhance the network programmability such that the forwarding plane becomes protocol-independent and can be dynamically reprogrammed to support new protocol stacks seamlessly. We first review the development of OpenFlow and explain the motivations for introducing POF. Then we explain the working principle of POF, discuss our efforts on realizing the POF development ecosystem, and show our implementation of POF-based source routing as a novel use case. Finally, we elaborate on the first WAN-based POF network testbed that includes POF switches located in two cities in China.},

Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities.

We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too},

	abstract = {Programmable data planes allow users to define their own data plane algorithms for network devices including appropriate data plane application programming interfaces (APIs) which may be leveraged by user-defined software-defined networking (SDN) control. This offers great flexibility for network customization, be it for specialized, commercial appliances, e.g., in 5G or data center networks, or for rapid prototyping in industrial and academic research. Programming protocol-independent packet processors (P4) has emerged as the currently most widespread abstraction, programming language, and concept for data plane programming. It is developed and standardized by an open community, and it is supported by various software and hardware platforms. In the first part of this paper we give a tutorial of data plane programming models, the P4 programming language, architectures, compilers, targets, and data plane APIs. We also consider research efforts to advance P4 technology. In the second part, we categorize a large body of literature of P4-based applied research into different research domains, summarize the contributions of these papers, and extract prototypes, target platforms, and source code availability. For each research domain, we analyze how the reviewed works benefit from P4’s core features. Finally, we discuss potential next steps based on our findings.},
