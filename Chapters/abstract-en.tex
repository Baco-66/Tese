Over the past three decades, there has been a surge in demand for the integration of internet connectivity within the domain of vehicular networks, commonly referred to as \glspl{vanet}. \gls{sdn} represents a novel networking paradigm that promises numerous benefits, the realization of which could potentially enhance \glspl{vanet}. This line of thinking has led to the emergence of \gls{sdvn}, with one of the primary obstacles to its adoption being the lack of experimental platforms utilizing real hardware. This problem represents a significant challenge for \gls{sdvn} research, as it is highly intricate and necessitates a comprehensive grasp of both \gls{sdn} and \gls{vanet} domains. Moreover, there is a dearth of research examining the integration of \gls{p4} and the second generation of \gls{sdn} with \glspl{vanet}. Given the novel nature of this endeavor and the exceptional complexity of these domains, solving this challenge presents a highly intriguing, yet difficult, objective.

This paper aims to address the existing gap in this field of study by presenting the development and implementation of an \gls{obu}/\gls{its} vehicle subsystem that complies fully with the specifications of \gls{sdn}. The proposed prototype is based on affordable and readily available hardware and utilizes open-source software wherever feasible. Additionally, this paper provides a new perspective on the future of the \gls{sdvn} field, based on a comprehensive global analysis. These findings present a potential trajectory for the evolution of \gls{sdvn} technology. This paper presents the development of a prototype comprising a PC Engines apu3d4 that operates the \gls{bmv2} \gls{p4} switch, communicating at 5.9GHz frequencies via the 802.11p standard. This solution establishes the necessary framework for the assembly of a comprehensive \gls{sdvn} environment in which tests may be conducted.
